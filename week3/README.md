In order to make a slideshow in the gallery page, I created separate div elements and add images to it in HTML. Additionally, I added thumbnail pictures below the slideshow for easy navigation.
Along with that, in order to add functionaility to the slideshow, I added JS functions. These involved creating constants which would store the number of images as well as the current image. Then, I added functions which would use these constants to switch between the images, either by using thumbnails or the using the previous and next buttons.  
One of the callenged I faced was getting images of the same size for the organisation of the images to result in a visually appealing slideshow.
